That's How I Roll Dice

-- a dice rolling application for roleplaying nerds

Have you ever been irritated by rolling dice and having them fall off the
table?  under something?  Ever sighed when you have to ask your buddies for the
twentieth time "Has anyone got another d12"?  Then third may be the app for
you.  third packs all the random-number-generating punch of dice, without the
issues that come with having to carry around and physically hurl regular
polyhedra.

third allows you to roll up pretty much any configuration of the standard
roleplaying dice sets, as well as add modifiers and custom dice sizes.  If you
have a particular roll you find yourself making frequently, save it as a
preset.  Presets are saved under separate profiles, so you don't need to worry
about getting your wizard's attack roll mixed up with your rogue's initiative.
