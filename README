THIR - That's How I Roll

	A dice roller by Brendan Jurd

Installation:

	Just extract the executable file thir.exe to wherever you like.  "C:\Program Files\thir\" is a good choice.
	Then run it.  The program is entirely self contained.

Usage:

	Each of the icons along the top of the application represents a different die.  It should be pretty obvious to any tabletop gamer which is which, but in any case, the icons are, in order of appearance:

		d2	A coin
		d4	A regular tetrahedron
		d6	A cube
		d8	A regular octahedron
		d10	A pentagonal trapezohedron
		d12	A regular dodecahedron
		d20	A regular icosahedron
		d100	Two d10s

	The input box underneath each die is how many of that die you want to roll.  You can change this number by typing the number directly into the input box, but unless you are rolling a very strange number of dice, you probably want to do it by clicking on the dice icons.  Clicks modify the corresponding dice counter like this:

		Left click		Adds 1
		Right click		Removes 1
		Shift + left click	Adds 5
		Shift + right click	Removes 5

	The "Multiplier" is exactly what it sounds like.  After your dice are rolled, the total will be multiplied by this number.  If you don't want a multiplier, just leave it at the default value of 1.

	The "Modifier" is added (or subtracted, if it's negative) to your roll after the dice are totalled and the multiplier (if any) is applied.

	When you've set things up to your liking, hit "Roll".  This is also exactly what it sounds like.

	The results of your roll will be shown in the listbox to the right, and the final total is displayed at the bottom right corner.

	You can repeatedly roll the same configuration of dice by just pressing the "Roll" button again.

	If you are sick of your current configuration and want to start again from scratch, press the "Reset" button.

Uninstallation
	
	Delete the file.
